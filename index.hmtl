                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                Hello, World! I am an aspiring junior software developer looking to launch my career fairly soon!
                I finished the CS50 course and would like to get all of the practice I can get. I am familiar with
                the following languages: C, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I don't consider myself a professional in any
                of these languages yet, but with a little bit of practice, the sky is the limit!
                </p>
                <p>
                I come from the world of public service, having worked in New York City Government for the last 7 years.
                I have always liked helping people, but another passion of mine is challenging my mind and coming up with great ideas.
                Coding is an opportunity for me to continue challenging myself!
